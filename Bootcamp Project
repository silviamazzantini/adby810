  <p> Originally from Italy, where programming is a rather uncommon thing to do.
        Before Bootcamp, I only knew some HTML5, which I used to create my first web page, where I posted some of the photos I took with my Canon.
      I remember staying up all night twice in a row, trying to figure out how to create this web page - I loved it,
      I loved the fact that I had the tools to create absolutely anything from nothing at all.
      I felt powerful. I guess that's how it started.
  I have tried to learn how to use Blender and how to program in C++ in the past as well, as I'm interested in creating video games.
As of now, I would like to become an ethical hacker, but I'd also like to be able to create my own apps and much more.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Spinning Wheel</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
	City (2020). This Processing project was created with the use of conditionals, loops, randomness, interaction and animation of images.
  It consists of a spinning wheel divided into four sections, each with a set 'condition' on it.
  Depending on which condition the arrow stops on when the user clicks on it,
  the screen turns black and a quote appears.
  I also inserted a sequence of animated triangles at the top of the screen, as a sort of decoration. <a href="https://github.com/silviamazzantini/adby810">Check out the code on Github!</a>
